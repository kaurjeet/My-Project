<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>About Ludhiana</h2>
<center><img src="ld.jpg"></center>

<p><img src="pau.jpg"> The city was founded in 1480
 by members of Delhi’s ruling Lodī dynasty, from which its name is derived.
 It is on the Grand Trunk Road from Delhi to Amritsar at a junction
 of several rail lines and is a major agricultural market and industrial centre.
 Ludhiana’s largest industry is hosiery manufacturing, but the production of
 cotton textiles, steel, and machinery and the processing of agricultural
 products are also economically important. The city is the site of
 Punjab Agricultural University (founded 1962) and a number of other colleges
; a U.S. Presbyterian mission operates a medical college and a hospital in the city. 
The area surrounding Ludhiana is mostly cultivated, much of it irrigated by the
 Sirhind Canal. The crops grown include wheat, corn (maize), cotton, and peanuts </p>
<h3>History<h3>
<p><img src="fort1.jpg">Ludhiana was founded in 1480 by members of the ruling Lodhi dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate.[16]
 The ruling sultan, Sikandar Lodhi, dispatched two ruling chiefs, Yusuf Khan and Nihad Khan, to re-assert Lodhi control.
 The two men camped at the site of present Ludhiana, which was then a village called Mir Hota. Yusuf Khan crossed the
 Sutlej and established Sultanpur, while Nihad Khan founded Ludhiana on the site of Mir Hota.
The name was originally Lodhi-ana", meaning "Lodhi town", which has since shifted from "Lodiana" to the present form of Ludhiana.
 The Lodhi Fort, or "Purana Qila", is the only surviving structure in the city from this period; located in the neighbourhood of Fatehgarh,
 it was well-maintained under Ranjit Singh and the British after him, but then fell into disrepair.
 It was declared a state-protected monument in December 2013.The Semi Centennial Celebration of the
 American Presbyterian Lodiana Mission was held in Ludhiana from 3–7 December 1884.
Ludhiana's Old City includes landmarks like the Lodhi Fort, Daresi Grounds, The Clock Tower, & Sood Family Haveli.</p>
